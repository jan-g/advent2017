--- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---

A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a passphrase instead of simply a password. A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.

To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.

For example:

    aa bb cc dd ee is valid.
    aa bb cc dd aa is not valid - the word aa appears more than once.
    aa bb cc dd aaa is valid - aa and aaa count as different words.

The system's full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input. How many passphrases are valid?

parse ls = ls & map words

valid words = C.count words & Map.filter (> 1) & Map.null

day4 ls = let phrases = parse ls

--- Part Two ---

For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.

For example:

    abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
    abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
    a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be used when forming another word.
    iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
    oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.

Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid?
